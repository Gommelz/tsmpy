Main idea comes from [A Generic Framework for the Topology-Shape-Metrics Based Layout](https://rtsys.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~biblio/downloads/theses/pkl-mt.pdf)

# Requirements for input graph
* Planar
* Connected
* Max node degree is no more than 4

# Existing problems
* Edge and node overlays in output

# TODO
* Cleaner code
* Fix bugs
